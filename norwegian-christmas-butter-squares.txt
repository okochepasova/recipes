Ingredients:
 - 1 cup unsalted butter, softened
 - 1 egg
 - 1 cup sugar
 - 2 cups flour
 - 1 tsp vanilla
 - ½ tsp salt
 - Turbinado/ Raw Sugar for dusting

Directions:
 1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Chill a 9x13″ baking pan in the freezer. 
    Do not grease the pan.

 2. Using a mixer, blend the butter, egg, sugar, and salt together until it is 
    creamy.  Add the flour and vanilla and mix using your hands until the 
    mixture holds together in large clumps. If it seems overly soft, add a 
    little extra flour. 

 3. Using your hands, press the dough out onto the chilled and ungreased baking 
    sheet until it is even and ¼ inch thick.  Dust the top of the cookies 
    evenly with raw sugar.

 4. Bake at 400 degrees until the edges turn a golden brown, about 12-15 
    minutes. Remove from the oven. Let cool for about five minutes before 
    cutting the cooked dough into squares. Remove the squares from the warm pan 
    using a spatula.
